# Machine Learning Tutorials

## Introduction

You are going to develop a small Python package that runs on a mini computer located in the wilderness.

The core functionalities of the program are:
 
1. Received audio data from a file
2. Pre-process / split  the audio data into chunks
3. Receive metadata from the microphone
4. Run a machine learning model on the pre-processed data to classify song birds
5. Send the classification result to a server via a serial connection to a Raspberry Pi Pico

Each step has it's own lessons you can follow. If you are already familiar with Python you may also try to solve the problem on your own without using the lessons.
