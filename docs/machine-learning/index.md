# Machine Learning Tutorials

## Introduction

You are going to develop a small S that runs on a mini computer located in the wilderness.

The core functionalities of the program are:
 
1. received audio data from a file
2. preprocess / split  the audio data into chunks
3. receive metadata from the microphone
4. run a machine learning model on the preprocessed data to classify song birds
5. send the classification result to a server via a serial connection to a Raspberry Pi Pico
