# TU Ilmenau ScienceCamp 2024 - Tutorial Pages

## Introduction

Welcome to ScienceCamp 2024! This Web-Pages contains some tips, references and guidelines that will help you in the workshops. You may also refer to them later when you want to continue of what you have started during the workshops. Each Section is dedicated to one of the scientific topics of this years demonstrator. 

## 2024 Demonstrator

In this year we are going to create the basic structure of a bird voice classification system. You will learn the basics of how a bird voice is recorded and fed into a computer system. To find out, which bird has been recorded you will you a neural network to classify the recorded audio. 

Since birds usually occur in the wild, the system will be designed that (in theory) it may be used in the field. You will learn how to transmit your classification data via a long range transmission network. 

Data is only as good as it is visualized. Therefore on the reception side of the transmission you will create a simple dashboard that visualizes your classification results in a web browser. 

The workshops cover three main parts:
