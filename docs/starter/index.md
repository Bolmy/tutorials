## Lessons Steps

### Create the basic structure of your Python project 

1. Create a new project folder for your Songbird classification project: `birdnet-mini`
2. Inside the folder create another folder called `birdnet_mini` (Notice the underscore!) this will be your Python package name.
3. Inside the folder `birdnet_mini` create a file with the name `main.py`. This will be the main entry point to your program. Your project folder should now look like this:
    ```
    └───birdnet-mini
        └───birdnet_mini
                main.py
    ```

### Start your Python editor / IDE (PyCharm) and load your project

Now you are ready to start!

1. Open the PyCharm IDE (Integrated Development Environment) by clicking its icon:
